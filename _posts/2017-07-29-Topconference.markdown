We always need to check the update from the AI research society. The best way to do is to go through the top conferences to find interesting things. Here I list some of it:


Top in general machine learning:
1. [NIPS (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems)](https://nips.cc "Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems")
2. [ICML (International Conference on Machine Learning)](https://2017.icml.cc "International Conference on Machine Learning")
3. [ICLR (International Conference on Learning Representations)](https://www.iclr.cc "International Conference on Learning Representations")
4. [AISTATS (International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics)](http://www.aistats.org "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics")
5. [COLT (Conference On Learning Theory)](http://www.learningtheory.org/colt2017/the-conference/sponsors-2/ "Conference On Learning Theory") 

The last two is small conference but it's as good as the others.

Region conference:
1. [ACML (Asia Conference on Machine Learning)](http://www.acml-conf.org/2017 "Asia Conference on Machine Learning")



Top in computer vision:
1. [CVPR (Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)](http://cvpr2017.thecvf.com "Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition")
2. [ICCV (International Conference on Computer Vision)](http://iccv2017.thecvf.com "International Conference on Computer Vision")
3. [ECCV (European Conference on Computer Vision)](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/program?id=800&f=European "European Conference on Computer Vision")
4. [ACCV (Asia Conference on Computer Vision)](http://www.accv2016.org "Asia Conference on Computer Vision")
